            <p>Filigree is a delicate kind of jewellery metalwork, usually of gold and silver, made with tiny beads or
                twisted threads, or both in combination, soldered together or to the surface of an object of the same
                metal and arranged in artistic motifs.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Though filigree has become a special branch of jewellery in modern times, it was historically part of
                the ordinary work of the jeweler. Indeed, all the jewelry of the Etruscans and Greeks (other than that
                intended for the grave, and therefore of an unsubstantial character) was made by soldering together and
                so building up the gold rather than by chiselling or engraving the material.</p>

            <p>The English word filigree is shortened from the earlier use of filigreen which derives from Latin "filum"
                meaning thread and "granum" grain, in the sense of small bead. The Latin words gave filigrana in Italian
                which itself became filigrane in 17th-century French.</p>
